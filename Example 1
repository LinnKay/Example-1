Hey Urijah (: Remember not to jump while sleeping in Dr. Biswas's class.... or else you get returned to your dorm. Rest well and enjoy the rest of these six weeks. By the way, I think you and Jalen make a really sweet couple and remind me so much of my boyfriend and I. You're, also, a really cool person and fun to be around!
